# 3D-Model-Orchid-Coasters
Various custom plant coasters/trays that I made especially made for my orchids, so that the water doesnt spill from its drainage hole while fitting the space limitations of my window sill.

## Resulting Print
Various pictures of the resulting prints. Some of them are not used for the orchids anymore as they have outgrown their original pots, but they have been repurposed and are used elsehwere now! :D
